Sounds like gsearch nonbrand is our major  traffic source, but we need to understand if those sessions are driving sales
Could you please calculate the CONVERSION RATE(CVR) from session to order?
Based on what we are paying for clicks we'll need a CVR of atleast 4% to make the numbers work.
If we are much lower we need to reduce bids. If we are higher, we can increase bids to drive more volume. */
